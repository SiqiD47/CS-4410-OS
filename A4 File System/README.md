We have prepared a tutorial video for you to get started. You can watch it on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/EO7nBmw-Scc) or download the file from [Canvas](https://login.canvas.cornell.edu/). Then read `start_code/README.md` for project details and submit your solutions to CMSx. 

## Setup Environment

You need the same Linux environment as A1. If you use Mac in A1, you need to switch to Linux this time. You can (1) use your local Linux; (2) use the ugc linux server provided [here](http://it.coecis.cornell.edu/cis/cisugcvm/); (3) use virtual box image provided [here](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4410/2020sp/resources/). 

To get started, run the following command to clone the repo into your Linux. 

```
> git clone https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/yz2327/A4.git
  # the starter code is now in ./A4/start_code
